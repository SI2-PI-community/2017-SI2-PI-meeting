# 2017 NSF SI2 PI meeting

The 2017 NSF Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI^2) Principal Investigator (PI) workshop was held 21--22 February 2017 at the Westin Arlington Gateway in Arlington, VA.

The workshop had five strategic objectives that align with the broader SI2 program goals:
- Serve as a focused forum for PIs to share technical information with each other and NSF Program Officers.
- Explore innovative topics emerging within software communities.
- Discuss emerging best practices across the supported software projects.
- Stimulate thinking on new ways of achieving software sustainability.
- Gather the shared experiences in an online web portal.
Achieving these five objectives will expand the collective domain of knowledge on software infrastructure, enhance the capability for sustained innovation within software communities, and contribute to the broader CIF21 vision.
